# Albion Market Data Relay (amdr)
AMDR is designed to help aggregate and share market information
for the MMO Albion Online. It is heavily influenced by the EVE
Market Data Relay project for EVE Online.

Those looking to get market data simply need to open a websocket
connection and they will have access to a firehose of data.
